# Numerical solution of the problem of static for nonlinear elastic truss structures
Implementation in C of the Newton-Raphson method for the numerical solution of the problem of static for nonlinear elastic truss structures.

In directory "theory-truss-structure" is fully developed the mathemetical theory behind the mechanics and thermodynamics of truss structures. In directory "linear-algebra" there are "matrix.c" and "lu.c" in which are implemented respectively some functions related to matrix manipulation and to LU factorization (in particular there is the parallel algorithm for LU factorization). In directory "newton-raphson" there is file "nr.c" in which is implemented the Newton-Raphson method. In directory "elasticity" there are files "element.c" for managing elements and "structure.c" for managing structures (in this file is implemented the function for find the equilibrium configuration). In directory "bridge" and "arch" there is the application of the method to the solution of the problem of static for a bridge and a catenary arch: here there are also the Julia scripts for drawing and animate the structures. In directory "some-gifs" there are some gifs related to the bridge. Eventually in "presentation" there is a Beamer presentation related to the topic.
